# Easy Logger

This project was created to provide an easy to use and configurable logging library. If the default configuration is sufficient for your needs the library can be used out of the box without further setup. However, if you have specific logging needs you can alter the library configuration settings and also provide custom logging methods.

The default implementation is capable of:

- Recording to text log files
- Recording to JSON log files
- Recording to SQL databases
- Adding dated folders to text-based logs (ex. /logs/2020/05/01/log.log)
- Adding dated filenames to text-based logs (ex. /logs/2020-05-01.log)
- Adding custom column names to SQL based logs

This can also be extended to record logs via custom logging endpoints.
